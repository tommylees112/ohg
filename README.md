Oxford Hydrology Group

This repository contains code snippets for working with hydrological, climatological and geospatial data.

***

## TODO:
* need to create a style for cookbook snippets
* add other contributors
* come up with a set of community rules for running the repository

# IDEAS:
1. structure the repository by data types:
	* geospatial field data
	* time series data
	* earth observation data

2. structure repository by language
	* bash
	* python
	* R

3. Structure by themes
	* climate impact
	* geomorphological change

4. Just a repository of blog post like work?
